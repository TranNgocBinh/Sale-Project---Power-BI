# Sale-Project---Power-BI
There are two ways to get the data:
1. You can use the data files from excel file. However, I don't recommend this way because it is quite normal and unautommated.
2. Importing dump file into My SQL workplace, then connect the data to power bi. By this way, you guys can query to check whether our DAXs are correct or not. It's beneficial right?
Good luck and let play with the data.
